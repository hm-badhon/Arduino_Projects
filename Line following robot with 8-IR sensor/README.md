# Line-Follower-robot-with-8-IR-array-sensors-

Hardware Components: 8-Array sensors, Arduino-UNO, L298-N Motor Driver. 
This Line follower Robot is a very simple robot that follows a line, and my robot follows a black line. 
This robot stops following the line when it reaches the endpoint or if no endpoint is available in the path then it continuously follows the black line.
As it has 8 sensors so, this worked better than my previous Line follower robot, which is with the 3-IR sensor array.
So, this Line Follower Robot works more accurately if it faced any critical line.
